# Explication    :   
lets explain    code  *  *      :           
      
1. `from bs4 import BeautifulSoup`: This line imports the `BeautifulSoup` class from the `bs4` (Beautiful Soup 4) library. `BeautifulSoup` is a popular Python library used for web scraping and parsing HTML and XML documents.
 
2. `import requests`: This line imports the `requests` library, which is commonly used to send HTTP requests to websites and retrieve their content.

3. `url = "https://isimsf.rnu.tn/fra/enseignants"`: Here, a variable named `url` is assigned the URL of a web page you want to scrape. In this case, it's set to "https://isimsf.rnu.tn/fra/enseignants". 

4. `response = requests.get(url)`: This line sends an HTTP GET request to the URL specified in the `url` variable and stores the response in the `response` variable. The response object contains information about the HTTP response, such as the status code (e.g., 200 for a successful request).

5. `response`: This line simply prints the `response` object, which may show the status code (e.g., `<Response [200]>`) if the request was successful.

6. `data = response.text`: This line extracts the content of the response (the HTML content of the web page) and stores it in the `data` variable as a string. This content will be parsed by BeautifulSoup in the next steps.

7. `soup = BeautifulSoup(data, 'html.parser')`: This line creates a `BeautifulSoup` object called `soup`. It takes the HTML content in the `data` variable and specifies the parser to be used ('html.parser'). The `soup` object allows you to parse and search the HTML content easily.

8. `profiles = soup.find_all('div', {'class': 'tcard-front'})`: This line uses the `find_all` method of the `soup` object to find all the `<div>` elements with a `class` attribute of 'tcard-front'. These elements represent profiles on the web page and are stored in the `profiles` variable as a list.

9. Comment: `# Initialize an empty list to store the extracted information.`: This is a comment indicating the purpose of the following code.

10. `l = []`: This line initializes an empty list named `l` that will be used to store the extracted information from the profiles.

11. Comment: `# Loop through the profiles.`: This comment explains the purpose of the loop that follows.

12. `for profile in profiles:`: This line starts a `for` loop that iterates through each of the profiles found on the web page.

13. `name = profile.find('div', {'class': 'h2'}).text.strip()`: This line finds the name of the individual in the profile. It searches for a `<div>` element with a `class` attribute of 'h2' within the `profile` and extracts the text inside it after stripping any leading or trailing whitespace. The `name` variable is assigned this extracted name.

14. `print(name)`: This line prints the extracted name to the console.

15. `mail = profile.find_all('a')[1]`: This line finds the second `<a>` element (hyperlink) within the `profile`, which is presumably an email address.

16. `address = 'None'`: This line initializes the `address` variable with the default value 'None'.

17. Comment: `# Default value in case email address is not found.`: This comment explains that 'None' is used as a default value in case an email address is not found.

18. `if len(mail.get('href').strip()) > 7:`: This line checks if the `href` attribute of the email hyperlink contains more than 7 characters. This is used as a condition to determine if an email address is present.

19. `address = mail.get('href')[7:]`: If the condition in the previous line is met, this line extracts the email address by slicing the `href` attribute from the 8th character (position 7) onwards. The extracted email address is assigned to the `address` variable..

20. `print(address)`: This line prints the extracted email address to the console.

21. `web_page = profile.find_all('a')[0].get('href')`: This line extracts the URL of the web page associated with the profile by finding the first `<a>` element in the `profile` and getting the `href` attribute.

22. `print(web_page)`: This line prints the extracted web page URL to the console.

23. `l.append([name, address, web_page])`: This line appends a list containing the extracted `name`, `address`, and `web_page` to the `l` list. This allows you to store the information for later use.

24. `print('*****************')`: This line prints a separator to distinguish between different profiles in the console output.

 This code essentially scrapes a web page for profiles, extracts information such as names, email addresses, and web page URLs, and stores that information in 
 the `l` list for further processing.
